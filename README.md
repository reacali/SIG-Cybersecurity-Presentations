# SIG-Cybersecurity-Presentations

Welcome to the Cybersecurity Special Interest Group (SIG) Presentation Repository! As president of the Cybersecurity SIG, I've created this collection of slideshows to serve as a resource for beginners and enthusiasts interested in cybersecurity fundamentals. Here, you'll find introductory material covering key cybersecurity concepts and practical walkthroughs of Capture the Flag (CTF) challenges. Each presentation aims to build a solid foundation and hands-on understanding of essential cyber skills.
